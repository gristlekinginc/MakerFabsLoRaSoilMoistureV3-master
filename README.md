# MakerFabs LoRa Soil Moisture V3 - Platformio
I'll start this by saying I don't know what I'm doing, but I aim to stay close to competent folks who help me.  This journey kicked off when I was looking for a sensor to put on the Helium network for a project in local wetlands called vernal pools.

I found the MakerFabs V3 option and ordered a few.

The upside of them is they are cheap, available, and have a known working sketch on Arduino.  All of those remain true.

As an entry level geek, I got frustrated at the number of attempts it took to flash the device, which appears to be a combination of not using the MakerFabs suggested USB to serial/TTL converter and the Arduino sketch being right at the capacity limit of the device.
